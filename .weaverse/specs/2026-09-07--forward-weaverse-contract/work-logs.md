# Work Logs

## 2026-09-07 — @hta218

- Starting SHA: `3972c8dc` (`main`, after Weaverse/forward#64). Branch
  `feat/forward-weaverse-contract` created from it.
- The connection gate was confirmed open in session. builder#2660's body still
  carried the older "do not begin connection work yet" wording; that
  contradiction and the Shared Contract version disagreement (`0.12-draft` in
  #2660 versus `0.14-accepted` in epic #2663) were raised on #2660 rather than
  resolved unilaterally.
- Verified live registry state before writing the contract: `@weaverse/next`
  dist-tag `alpha` resolves to `0.1.0-alpha.16`; `latest` is still the stale
  `0.1.0-alpha.0`. Updated epic #2663 and issue #2660, both of which still
  described `alpha.15` as current and told readers not to claim `alpha.16`
  before registry verification.
- Confirmed Forward's current Weaverse state directly from the tree rather than
  from the issues: `package.json` carries no `@weaverse/next` dependency,
  `.weaverse/` holds only `specs/`, and there is no Weaverse config or project
  connection.
- Derived the section inventory from Forward's real page composition at
  `main@3972c8d`, not from Pilot or the Next POC. The seven `INDEX` sections are
  named from the headings the page actually renders today ("Forward / Field
  equipment 2026", "New field rotation", "Shop by system", the product
  spotlight, "Material standard", "One-day kit", "Repair, not replace" with
  "Latest field note").
- Recorded the cache plan from the route directives already in the tree
  (`revalidate = 3600` on `/`, PDP and collection; `dynamicParams = false` on
  four dynamic routes; `force-dynamic` + `force-no-store` on cart, account, and
  the two account/cart route handlers) so published-mode behavior is preserved
  rather than redesigned.
- Two ownership decisions were made deliberately and are argued in the spec
  rather than assumed: the Header/Footer stay theme-owned in this slice because
  their keyboard, focus-trap, inert, body-lock, and fail-soft contracts would
  otherwise sit behind merchant-editable data with no coverage for the failure
  modes; and the PDP buy block plus the collection grid stay theme-owned
  because they own variant identity, URL query state, and the checkout handoff.
- No dependency was installed, no Weaverse project created, no Studio
  composition started, and no production code, test, or configuration changed.
  This slice is documentation-only.
